Programming language, is a set of commands, written according
to rules defined by the programming language, and then these
commands go through several stages until they are executed on
the computer. Based on its proximity to human languages,
programming languages are divided into:

<ol type="1">

<li>A high-level language (close to the language human beings
understand) such as: C-Sharp, Python, and Java.</li>

<li>Low level language (close to machine language) such as:
assembly language.</li>

</ol>

Sometimes it is divided according to desired purposes from the language used. There are languages that are designed to work on specific devices, such as for a company to produce a computer or central processor (central processing unit), and provide it with a user guide containing the commands that are executed on it, and there are other more general languages that work independently of the type of machine, that is, It works within a virtual machine, such as the Java language. Programming can be defined as the process of writing instructions and commands for a computer or other device, to direct it and inform it of how to handle data or how to carry out a series of required actions. The programming process follows rules for the language chosen by the programmer . Each language has its own characteristics that distinguish it from the other and make it suitable in varying degrees for each type of program and the task required of this program .The programming languages also have common characteristics and common borders, since all of these languages are designed to deal with computers. The programming languages develop with the development of the computer hardware. When the electronic computer was invented in the forties and fifties of the last century (after the electrical calculation devices in the twenties) - and the computer was operating in large numbers of electronic valves - the programming language was also complicated, and it was a series of numbers and written in the form of long code codes these numbers are The numbers zero 0 and one 1 and this language is called bilingual or machine language, and this was difficult for programmers.

<b>How do programming languages differ from each other?</b>
Programming languages arise when programmers think of a way to express an arithmetic concept in a simpler way, and if the rest of the programmers adopt the language and write their programs in them, the language spreads, and if the opposite happens, the language slowly ends and dies. Each programming language has strengths and weaknesses and the purpose for which the language will be used is what determines the most appropriate language. For example, FORTRAN is a particularly good language for processing numerical data, but it is not useful in organizing large programs. Pascal is very good for writing well-organized programs that are easy to read, but not as flexible as C programming language.
C ++ is a strong language that represents OOP but is hard to learn.

<b>Characteristics of programming languages:-</b>
The programming language is basically a method that makes it easy for the programmer to write his program in the form of instructions and commands that the computer understands in order to carry out the required work. It is known that the computer converts the scripted language into a series of 0 and 1, on the basis of which it begins its work. To write commands, the chosen programming language provides a set of basic matters to draw upon during the program's creation process and a set of rules that enable you to manipulate and organize information for the purpose of performing the required work.
These principles and rules are generally:
<ol type="A">
<li>Information and storage.</li>
<li>Orders and organizing their conduct.</li>
<li>Special design.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<b>Uses of programming languages:- </b> The uses of programming languages are many and endless, perhaps the most famous are: web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, games and simulation programs, calculation programs and many others. As you know, we mean here high-level languages .
