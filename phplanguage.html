<h1>PHP language:-</h1>

<p>
PHP language was created to build interactive websites, PHP works on the server side language, which means that we as users of the site can not see the PHP codes used in the site, and the server handles the language codes and sends them to the browser in the form of HTML.

PHP can handle files on the server, get data from Forms fields, deal with cookies, deal with databases, control user access to site pages, encrypt data “like passwords” and others.
Through the PHP language, you can convert static web pages to a real site and add many features, for example, searching within the site, registering members, adding articles automatically and others.
